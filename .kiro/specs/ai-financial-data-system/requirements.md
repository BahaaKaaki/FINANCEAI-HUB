# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for an intelligent financial data processing system that integrates diverse financial data sources (QuickBooks and Rootfi formats) into a unified backend system with powerful AI capabilities. The system will provide natural language querying, intelligent data processing, and AI-powered financial insights to create a single source of truth for financial data analysis.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Data Integration and Processing

**User Story:** As a financial analyst, I want to integrate data from multiple financial sources (QuickBooks and Rootfi) into a unified system, so that I can access all financial information from a single interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system receives QuickBooks P&L data THEN it SHALL parse the monthly column structure and extract account information accurately
2. WHEN the system receives Rootfi financial data THEN it SHALL parse the hierarchical line items and account structures correctly
3. WHEN data from both sources is processed THEN the system SHALL normalize and store it in a unified database schema
4. WHEN duplicate or conflicting data is detected THEN the system SHALL implement intelligent conflict resolution with data quality scoring
5. WHEN missing or inconsistent data is found THEN the system SHALL flag it for review and apply appropriate validation rules

### Requirement 2: RESTful API Design

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clean RESTful endpoints to access financial data and AI features, so that I can build applications on top of the financial system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I request financial data THEN the system SHALL provide endpoints for retrieving revenue, expenses, and profit data by time periods
2. WHEN I need to query specific accounts THEN the system SHALL provide endpoints to filter by account types and categories
3. WHEN I want to access AI features THEN the system SHALL provide dedicated endpoints for natural language queries and insights
4. WHEN API errors occur THEN the system SHALL return appropriate HTTP status codes with descriptive error messages
5. WHEN API documentation is requested THEN the system SHALL provide interactive API documentation via FastAPI's automatic documentation

### Requirement 3: Natural Language Query Processing

**User Story:** As a business user, I want to query financial data using natural language, so that I can get insights without learning complex query syntax.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I ask "What was the total profit in Q1?" THEN the system SHALL interpret the query, fetch relevant data, and provide a clear numerical answer with context
2. WHEN I request "Show me revenue trends for 2024" THEN the system SHALL analyze revenue patterns and present trend information with supporting data
3. WHEN I ask "Which expense category had the highest increase this year?" THEN the system SHALL perform comparative analysis and identify the category with percentage changes
4. WHEN I ask "Compare Q1 and Q2 performance" THEN the system SHALL provide side-by-side comparison with key metrics and variance analysis
5. WHEN follow-up questions are asked THEN the system SHALL maintain conversation context and provide contextually relevant responses
6. WHEN ambiguous queries are received THEN the system SHALL ask clarifying questions or provide multiple interpretation options

### Requirement 4: AI-Powered Financial Insights

**User Story:** As a financial manager, I want AI-generated insights and narratives from financial data, so that I can quickly understand business performance and trends.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN financial data is analyzed THEN the system SHALL generate concise narratives like "Revenue increased by 10% in Q2, primarily driven by strong sales growth"
2. WHEN expense analysis is requested THEN the system SHALL provide insights like "Operating expenses rose 15% due to increased payroll and office costs"
3. WHEN cash flow analysis is performed THEN the system SHALL generate summaries like "Cash flow improved significantly with better collection rates"
4. WHEN seasonal patterns are detected THEN the system SHALL report findings like "Seasonal patterns show December revenue peaks at 180% of monthly average"
5. WHEN anomalies are detected THEN the system SHALL flag unusual patterns and provide explanations for investigation

### Requirement 5: Data Validation and Quality Assurance

**User Story:** As a data administrator, I want robust data validation and quality checks, so that I can ensure the accuracy and reliability of financial information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN financial data is ingested THEN the system SHALL validate numerical accuracy and detect impossible values (negative revenue, etc.)
2. WHEN date ranges are processed THEN the system SHALL ensure chronological consistency and flag overlapping periods
3. WHEN account mappings are created THEN the system SHALL verify account hierarchies and detect circular references
4. WHEN data quality issues are found THEN the system SHALL log detailed error reports with suggested corrections
5. WHEN data integrity checks run THEN the system SHALL verify that debits equal credits and totals reconcile correctly

### Requirement 6: Error Handling and Reliability

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive error handling and logging, so that I can maintain system reliability and troubleshoot issues effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN AI processing fails THEN the system SHALL gracefully degrade and provide alternative responses or cached results
2. WHEN database connections fail THEN the system SHALL implement retry logic with exponential backoff
3. WHEN LLM API calls timeout THEN the system SHALL handle timeouts gracefully and provide fallback responses
4. WHEN system errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information using structured logging with %s formatting
5. WHEN critical failures happen THEN the system SHALL send appropriate alerts and maintain system availability

### Requirement 7: Performance and Scalability

**User Story:** As a system user, I want fast response times for queries and analysis, so that I can work efficiently with financial data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN simple data queries are made THEN the system SHALL respond within 500ms for basic financial data retrieval
2. WHEN complex AI analysis is requested THEN the system SHALL provide progress indicators and complete within 10 seconds
3. WHEN multiple concurrent users access the system THEN it SHALL maintain performance without degradation
4. WHEN large datasets are processed THEN the system SHALL implement pagination and streaming for efficient data transfer
5. WHEN system load increases THEN the architecture SHALL support horizontal scaling of API and processing components

## Usage Examples

### Basic Query
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/ai/query" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"query": "What was the revenue last month?"}'
```

### Comparative Analysis
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/ai/query" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"query": "Compare Q1 2024 revenue to Q1 2023 and show growth trends"}'
```

### Follow-up Questions
```bash
# First query
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/ai/query" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"query": "What was our revenue last month?"}'

# Follow-up using the same conversation_id
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/ai/query" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"query": "How does that compare to expenses?", "conversation_id": "previous-conversation-id"}'
```

## Python API Usage

```python
from app.ai import get_financial_agent

# Initialize the agent
agent = get_financial_agent()

# Process a query
result = agent.process_query("What was the revenue last month?")
print(result['response'])

# Continue the conversation
result = agent.process_query(
    "How does that compare to the previous month?", 
    conversation_id=result['conversation_id']
)
print(result['response'])
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Required: At least one LLM provider API key
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key_here

# LLM Configuration
DEFAULT_LLM_PROVIDER=openai
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4
ANTHROPIC_MODEL=claude-3-sonnet-20240229
MAX_TOKENS=4000
TEMPERATURE=0.1
```

### Supported Models
- **OpenAI**: GPT-4, GPT-3.5-turbo, and newer models with function calling
- **Anthropic**: Claude-3 models (future support)

## Query Examples

### Revenue Analysis
- "What was our total revenue last month?"
- "Show me revenue by source for Q1 2024"
- "Compare revenue between QuickBooks and RootFi data"

### Comparative Analysis
- "Compare Q1 vs Q2 revenue and expenses"
- "How did our profit change year-over-year?"
- "Show the difference between this month and last month"

### Growth Analysis
- "Calculate monthly revenue growth for the past 6 months"
- "What's our profit growth trend?"
- "Show expense growth patterns"

### Anomaly Detection
- "Are there any unusual spikes in our revenue?"
- "Detect anomalies in expense patterns"
- "Find irregularities in profit data"

### Complex Multi-Step Queries
- "Analyze our financial performance for Q1, compare it to Q4, and identify any anomalies"
- "Show revenue trends, calculate growth rates, and highlight any concerning patterns"
- "Compare all metrics between this year and last year, then detect any unusual changes"

## Error Handling

The AI agent includes comprehensive error handling:

- **Validation Errors**: Invalid parameters or date formats
- **Data Not Found**: No data available for specified criteria
- **LLM Errors**: API failures or rate limiting
- **Tool Execution Errors**: Database or calculation failures

All errors are logged and returned with appropriate HTTP status codes and user-friendly messages.

## Performance Considerations

- **Conversation Cleanup**: Old conversations are automatically cleaned up
- **Rate Limiting**: Respects LLM provider rate limits
- **Caching**: Tool results are cached within conversations
- **Timeout Handling**: Requests have configurable timeouts

## Security

- API keys are stored securely in environment variables
- Input validation prevents injection attacks
- Conversation data is stored in memory (not persisted)
- No sensitive data is logged

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"LLM client is not properly configured"**
   - Ensure OPENAI_API_KEY or ANTHROPIC_API_KEY is set
   - Check that the API key is valid and has sufficient credits

2. **"No financial records found"**
   - Verify that financial data has been ingested
   - Check date ranges and filters in the query

3. **"Tool execution failed"**
   - Check database connectivity
   - Verify data integrity and format

### Debug Mode
Set `DEBUG=true` in your environment to enable detailed logging.

## Development

### Adding New Tools
1. Create the tool function in `app/ai/`
2. Add the tool to `FINANCIAL_TOOLS` registry
3. Define the tool schema in `tool_schemas.py`
4. Update the system prompt if needed

### Extending LLM Support
1. Add new provider client in `llm_client.py`
2. Update configuration in `config.py`
3. Add provider-specific message formatting

### Testing
Run the test suite to verify functionality:
```bash
python -m pytest tests/
```
